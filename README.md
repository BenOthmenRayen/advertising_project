# Advertising Sales Prediction using Regression (Python)

## Project Overview

This project aims to **analyze and predict sales** based on **advertising investments** across three channels:

- 📺 TV  
- 📻 Radio  
- 📰 Newspaper  

The project is implemented in **Python** using **linear regression models (simple and multiple)** to evaluate the impact of advertising spending on sales.

⚠️ **All detailed explanations, comments, visualizations, and results are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.**
