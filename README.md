# Advertising Sales Prediction using Regression (Python)

## Project Overview

This project aims to **analyze and predict sales** based on **advertising investments** across three channels:

- 📺 TV  
- 📻 Radio  
- 📰 Newspaper  

The project is implemented in **Python** using **linear regression models (simple and multiple)** to evaluate the impact of advertising spending on sales.

⚠️ **All detailed explanations, comments, visualizations, and results are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.**

## Part 2 – Extension with KNN and SVM Models

In the second part of this project, the initial regression analysis is extended by applying **non-linear machine learning models** on the same advertising dataset.  
The objective is to evaluate whether more advanced models can improve sales prediction performance compared to linear regression.

The following models are implemented:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression**

This part includes:
- Feature scaling (standardization) required for distance-based models
- Model training and prediction
- Performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² score
- A comparative analysis between linear regression, KNN, and SVM

➡️ **All detailed explanations, code comments, visualizations, and interpretations are provided in the dedicated Jupyter Notebook below.**
